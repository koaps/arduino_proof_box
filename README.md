# Arduino Controlled Proofing Box

![Proofing Box](https://i.imgur.com/edXFRzXl.jpg)

*Note: the jar is sitting on a container of water as a thermal load, I wouldn't put it directly on the heat mat*

I used an [Arduino Diecimila](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDiecimila) but you should be able to use any Arduino really, like an UNO or Nano.

An even better solution is using a [SparkFun Qwiic Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15795) which gives you I2C over their QWIIC connector making it very easy to add a [Digital Temperature Sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16304) or an [OLED Display](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17153) or all sorts of other stuff using [QWIIC](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic#products) or [Adafruit STEMMA](https://www.adafruit.com/category/1005), See [this page](https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/sparkfun-qwiic) for more info.

This uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to run [ino](http://inotool.org/) to build and upload the code to the Arduino.

I used digital pin 2 for the sensor and pin 7 for the relay

To change the Arduino hardware type, see the ino.ini file

To change the USB port, see the upload.sh also

First run the build the docker image
```
./build.sh
```

then upload code to th Arduino (it should be connected to a USB port)
```
./upload.sh
```

You can install minicom and connect to the console to see the current values of the sensor
```
minicom -D /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600

Tip: use `control+a`, then `z`, then `x` to exit minicom on OSX

The code will try to keep the temp between 74*F and 76*F (it will go slightly higher realistically, like 78*F), you can tweak that in the sketch.ino if you want, but should be good for bread and other ferments.
